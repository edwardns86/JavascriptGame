# CoderSchool FTW - * Game Task - Ed's Sweet Dreams *

Created with love by: Edward Stevens
  
This is a simple Canvas-based game that requires a solid understanding of the principles of JavaScript programming to customize. 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories.
You can find the gif in the images folder. 

## Code Reviews
 
  


## Required User Stories
- [ ] I have at least three code reviews from others.
- [x] The user can move their character with the arrow keys. 
- [x] The user can see a multiple items they must catch.
- [x] The items are placed at a random location within the game boundaries.
- [x] The user can catch an item by moving their character to the same location as a item.
- [x] When the user catches an item, a new item is placed randomly upon the screen.
- [x] The user can see the numbers of items she has caught. Every time she catches a monster, the number should increment by one. 
- [x] The game ends when the user has caught 20 monsters. The total time elapsed is displayed upon game completion, in seconds. // I removed this functionality as it clashed with the seconds rule.
- [x] The user can access this game from the internet (e.g. using Netlify).
- [ ] The code has been reviewed by at least one other person, using Pull Requests on GitHub. 
- [x] When user catches items the highscore increases if it's higher than the previous highscore.
- [x] User can see an input.
- [x] User can enter their name into the input.
- [x] When user catches monster their name is grabbed from the input and added to the highscore.
- [x] When timer is out the user cannot move the hero anymore.
- [x] User can see reset button. If user presses reset the game starts over.
- [x] User can see high score persisted over page loads.

## Optional User Stories

- [x] Custom styling: the developer has replaced the images for the main character, monster, and background with something of her choice.  
- [x] The user cannot move her character off the screen. 
- [] The user sees a few different types of monster each time a new monster is spawned. 
- [ ] The monster moves around on its own each frame, and the user must chase it. 
- [ ] The map has "obstacles", such as trees, which block the user from moving through the space occupied by the obstacle. 
- [ ] The user can hear sound effects upon movement and upon catching a monster. 
- [ ] The user hears background music during the game. 
- [ ] The user can see their high score. 


The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the page!

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: 25 hours spent in total.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Utilising local storage was a challenge and took a lot of the time spent, I was unable to implement the history of high scores array showing after completion of the game.
